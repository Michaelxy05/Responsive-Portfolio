    <p class="myself">
        Hello my name is Michael. I am a aspiring web developer, hoping to learn full stack, including the skills needed to become
        a proficient frontend and backend developer. I am currently attending UC Davis Extension Bootcamp. It is challenging
        especially in my position diving head first without ever testing the water. That's right, absolutely zero background
        in coding and if I remember correctly, my early college days were the last time I was around any type of computer
        and that was a decade ago.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="myself">
        So why coding? After years of working dead end jobs, I find myself wondering annually, "Is this what I'm going to do until
        my body can no longer function?". After talking to two of my family memebers who are currently in the web developer
        industry, I was convinced this is the path and career I must chase down. This is a field that is growing at a very
        fast pace and is showing no sign of slowing down. We are now living in a Tech World and there is no better time to
        enter into this competive job market.
